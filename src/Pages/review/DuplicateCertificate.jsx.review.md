* **Code smells:**

    * The code is not very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). There are many duplicated code blocks, for example, the code for the header and footer is duplicated in each certificate card.
    * The code is not very modular. The different components are not well-defined and there is a lot of global state.
    * The code is not very secure. There is no validation of user input, and the data is not encrypted.
    * The code is not very maintainable. It would be difficult to add new features or make changes to the existing code.

* **Technical debt:**

    * The code is not very performant. It could be made more efficient by using more performant libraries and by optimizing the code.
    * The code is not very extensible. It would be difficult to add new features or make changes to the existing code.

* **Security issues:**

    * The code is not very secure. There is no validation of user input, and the data is not encrypted. This could lead to security vulnerabilities.

* **Maintainability:**

    * The code is not very maintainable. It would be difficult to add new features or make changes to the existing code. The code is not very modular, and there is a lot of global state.

* **Following patterns:**

    * The code does not follow many of the common React patterns. For example, the state is not managed using a state management library, and the components are not very reusable.

* **Following best practices:**

    * The code does not follow many of the best practices for writing React code. For example, the code is not very DRY, and the code is not very modular.

* **Potential amount bugs:**

    * The code has a high potential for bugs. The code is not very well-written, and there are many duplicated code blocks. This makes it more likely that there will be bugs in the code.

* **Number of code duplicates:**

    * There are many duplicated code blocks in the code. For example, the code for the header and footer is duplicated in each certificate card.

* **Efforts spent on this code:**

    * It seems like the author spent a lot of time on this code. The code is very complex, and there are many duplicated code blocks.

* **Score from 1 to 12, based on the level of seniority:**

    * I would give this code a score of 3 out of 12, based on the level of seniority. The code is not very well-written, and there are many potential bugs. It would be difficult to add new features or make changes to the existing code.
