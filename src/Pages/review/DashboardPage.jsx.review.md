## Code Smells

* The code is not very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). For example, the `useEffect` hook is used twice to retrieve the user data from local storage.
* The code is not very modular. The `DashboardPage` component is responsible for both rendering the UI and retrieving the user data. It would be better to separate these responsibilities into different components.
* The code is not very performant. The `ChartData` component renders a chart using the Chart.js library. Chart.js is a powerful library, but it can be slow. It would be better to use a more lightweight library for rendering charts.

## Technical Debt

* The code is not very secure. The user data is stored in local storage. This is not a very secure way to store data, as it is not encrypted.
* The code is not very maintainable. The code is not very well organized, and it would be difficult for someone new to the project to understand how it works.

## Security Issues

* The user data is stored in local storage, which is not a very secure way to store data.

## Maintainability

* The code is not very well organized, and it would be difficult for someone new to the project to understand how it works.

## Following Patterns

* The code does not follow the React component pattern very well. The `DashboardPage` component is responsible for both rendering the UI and retrieving the user data. It would be better to separate these responsibilities into different components.

## Following Best Practices

* The code is not very performant. The `ChartData` component renders a chart using the Chart.js library. Chart.js is a powerful library, but it can be slow. It would be better to use a more lightweight library for rendering charts.

## Potential Amount of Bugs

* The code is not very well tested, and there is a potential for a lot of bugs.

## Number of Code Duplicates

* The `useEffect` hook is used twice to retrieve the user data from local storage.

## Efforts Spent on This Code

* It is difficult to say how much effort was spent on this code, but it does not appear to be very well-written.

## Score from 1 to 12, based on the level of seniority

* I would give this code a score of 3 out of 12, based on the level of seniority. The code is not very well-written, and it is not very maintainable. There are also some security issues and potential for a lot of bugs.
