* **Code smells:**

    * The code is not very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). There are several places where the same code is repeated, for example, the SVG code for the chart is duplicated in two places.
    * The code is not very modular. The different components of the chart are not well-separated, which makes it difficult to maintain and extend the code.
    * The code is not very performant. The SVG code for the chart is not optimized, which could lead to performance issues in a production environment.

* **Technical debt:**

    * The code is not using any styling libraries, which makes it difficult to maintain and style the code.
    * The code is not using any state management library, which makes it difficult to manage the state of the chart.

* **Security issues:**

    * The code does not appear to have any security issues.

* **Maintainability:**

    * The code is not very maintainable. The code is not very DRY, the code is not very modular, and the code is not very performant.

* **Following patterns:**

    * The code does not follow any specific patterns.

* **Following best practices:**

    * The code does not follow many best practices. The code is not very DRY, the code is not very modular, the code is not very performant, and the code is not using any styling libraries or state management libraries.

* **Potential amount of bugs:**

    * The potential amount of bugs in the code is high. The code is not very DRY, the code is not very modular, and the code is not very performant. This makes it more likely that there are bugs in the code.

* **Number of code duplicates:**

    * The number of code duplicates in the code is high. The SVG code for the chart is duplicated in two places. This makes it more difficult to maintain and extend the code.

* **Efforts spent on this code:**

    * The efforts spent on this code are medium. The code is not very complex, but it is not very easy to maintain either.

* **Score from 1 to 12, based on the level of seniority:**

    * I would give this code a score of 5 out of 12, based on the level of seniority. The code is not very complex, but it is not very easy to maintain either.
