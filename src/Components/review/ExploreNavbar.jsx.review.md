**Code Smells**

* The code is not very DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). There are many duplicated lines of code, for example, the code for the links to the different pages is duplicated in the desktop and mobile menus.
* The code is not very modular. The different components are not well-defined and there is a lot of code in the `ExploreNavbar` component that does not belong there.
* The code is not very performant. There is a lot of unnecessary DOM rendering, especially in the mobile menu.

**Technical Debt**

* The code is not very secure. There is no validation of the user input, for example, the user can enter any value for the username and password in the login form.
* The code is not very maintainable. It is difficult to add new features or make changes to the existing code because the code is not well-organized and there is a lot of duplicated code.

**Security Issues**

* The code does not have any form of user authentication or authorization. This means that any user can access any page on the website, even if they are not logged in.
* The code does not have any form of input validation. This means that a user can enter any value for the username and password in the login form, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

**Maintainability**

The code is not very maintainable. It is difficult to add new features or make changes to the existing code because the code is not well-organized and there is a lot of duplicated code.

**Following Patterns**

The code does not follow any specific coding patterns. This makes it difficult to understand and maintain the code.

**Following Best Practices**

The code does not follow many of the best practices for writing JavaScript code. For example, the code is not very DRY, the code is not very modular, and the code is not very performant.

**Potential Amount of Bugs**

The code has a high potential for bugs. There are many duplicated lines of code, the code is not very modular, and the code is not very performant. This makes it more likely that there will be bugs in the code.

**Number of Code Duplicates**

There are many duplicated lines of code in the ExploreNavbar component. For example, the code for the links to the different pages is duplicated in the desktop and mobile menus.

**Efforts Spent on This Code**

It seems like a lot of effort was spent on this code. The code is very complex and there are a lot of features. However, the code is not very well-written and it is difficult to maintain.

**Score from 1 to 12, based on the level of seniority**

I would give this code a score of 3 out of 12, based on the level of seniority. The code is not very well-written and it is difficult to maintain. There are many technical debt, security issues, and maintainability issues.
